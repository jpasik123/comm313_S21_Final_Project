## Data Files for COMM 313 Final Project
### Jessica Pasik 

* This folder contains the data files that I have used in my analysis for this final project. 

The breakdown of my project data is as follows:

`JBPFinalProjectData.csv` - an Excel chart converted to a CSV file; used with the Pandas Python package to then be converted to a clean, organized data frame

### Charts
