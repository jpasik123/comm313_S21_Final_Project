## Progress Presentation for COMM 313 Final Project
### Jessica Pasik 

The presentation included in this folder gives a brief overview of my COMM 313 final project that tracks the evolution of country music lyrics from the 1990s and 2010s by both male and female artists. In the PowerPoint, I share my research question and hypothesis as well as summaries of the data collection and organization process and the varying analyses I completed to find answers to my questions and hypotheses.
