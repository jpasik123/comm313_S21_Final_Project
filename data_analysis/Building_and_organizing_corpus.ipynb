    "This notebook will detail the processes underwent to collect, organize, and analyze the lyrics of top country music songs by male and female artists of the 1990s and 2010s. By analyzing songs from different time periods and from different decades, I hope to determine any significant similarities and/or differences in lyrics . Given that there was no pre-existing chart that sufficiently organized the exact data I wished to analyze, I created an Excel chart that scraped the decade, song title, artist(s), and gender for each song. Each song that was a part of this list was either labeled a top song for that respective time period by reputable news sources/websites, nominated for an award, or actually crowned a winning song. The chart also contained a diversity of artists to hopefully capture an array of lyrical topics/content. Once this chart was finalized, I then uploaded it to JupyterHub and transformed the rows of the data frame into separate dictionaries. I then used Genius API to pull the lyrics for all relevant songs, which then allowed me to further separate and organize my data. The corpus pulls lyrical data from a combined 80 songs (40 per decade; 20 per gender per decade)"
