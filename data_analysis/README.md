## Data Analysis Notebooks for COMM 313 Final Project
### Jessica Pasik

In this data_analysis folder, you will find various notebooks that outline and detail the various steps I took in creating and putting together this final project! 

*NOTE: The foundational code that the each notebook relies on stems from the `building_and_organizing_corpus` notebook.

Below, I have listed the various folders used for analysis:

`functions` - a separate notebook of the various functions used as the foundation for analysis 

`building_and_organizing_corpus` - a notebook detailing the various steps taken to find, organize and upload the data needed for analysis  

`frequency_ngram_analysis` - a notebook containing frequencies, n-gram lists, and word comparison charts

`keyness_analysis.ipynb` - this notebooks contains keyness analysis that is used to evaluate whether a particular word occurs more frequently in one corpus  compared to its occurrence in another corpus

`kwic_collocation_analysis.ipynb` - notebook containing KWIC concordance and collocation analyses; helpful for both contextualizing how each word/lyric is used and finding patterns and relationships between tokens

`partofspeech_tagging_analysis.ipynb` - notebook that distinguishes the part of speech for each lyric and the frequencies in which they occur
