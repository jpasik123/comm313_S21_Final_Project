    "Despite some people's aversion to country music, the genre remains one of the most-listened to and popular musical subcategories of our generation. The country music genre, dating back to the 1920s, has experienced various different musical tunes and styles; country music started with 'hillbilly' tunes, experimented with bluegrass and gospel music, and was followed by outlaw country and more folk and soft rock tunes. The most recent decade saw the injection of pop and rap into country music songs. Taking into account all of these details and stylistic shifts, I thought it best to dig a little deeper and see what insights I might find when analyzing country music lyrics over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about this project, I knew I had to narrow down my data set to make my research questions and hypotheses more targeted. As a result, I sought out to perform an exploratory analysis of country music lyrics from the 1990s - a big decade for country music - and the 2010s, to see if there were any interesting or significant patterns that stand out that could inform me how the country genre has evolved over the years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping this in mind, I have shared my research questions and hypotheses that will be tested in my data analysis below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "How has the country music genre changed over time – from the 1990s to 2010s? Are there any prevalent changes between men and women both within and between these decades? What evidence can I find through lyrical analysis that could tell me more about where the country genre is headed in the future? What can be expected?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis \n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesize that while there may be diversity in topics over the decades, the lyrical analysis will reveal great similarity in lyrics from the 1990s and 2010s; I believe any substantial lyrical differences will be more prominent between male and female artists. "

    "As I mentioned earlier, in order to narrow my findings, I decided to focus on country songs from the 1990s - a decade full of success and fame for the country genre - and the 2010s. I chose these two time periods with the hopes that I could distinguish lyrical differences between old country styles of the 1990s and more modern country tunes of the 2010s. In addition to the temporal aspect, I also decided to use gender as another unit of analysis so that I could see if there were any differences in the song lyrics written by male and female artists both between and within the decades. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that I could not find a pre-made data set or chart online that included the exact units of analysis I was looking for, I created an Excel chart of top songs from the 1990s and 2010s by male and female artists. I then transformed this chart into a Pandas data frame, which I then turned into separate dictionaries. After this, I relied on Genius API to scrape the lyrics for every song. Once I compiled all my lyrical data, I further separated and organized my data into various JSON files. The main corpus that will be referenced in all data analysis folders is `all_charts`; `all_charts` pulls lyrics from a combined 80 songs (40 per decade; 20 songs per gender per decade)."

    "### Observations - 1990s vs 2010s\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the frequencies and n-grams from the 1990s, there are frequent references to filler words such as \"oh\", \"yeah\", and \"really\", and \"hey\". However, there are also significant outliers that will be analyzed further throughout this notebook such as \"love\", \"heart\", \"baby\", and \"kisses\". Additionally, the average type-token ratio - or the amount of unique words across the `all_90s` data is 40.612394807300554, showing there was not significant variety in words used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the data from the 1990s, the frequencies and n-grams from the `all_2010s` data displayed a lot more lyrical variety, with words such as \"dirt\", \"road\", \"mama\" and \"hope\". There were also some distinct word pairs such as \"whiskey glasses\", \"taste tequila\", and \"drunk plane\" that seem to detail a storyline not present in the 1990s chart. Also, the average type-token ratio among 2010s songs is 37.27572078056541, only slightly lower than that of the 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, I included a chart of words that appeared in the top 50 of both the 1990s and 2010s chart. Words such as \"love\" and \"heart\" appeared in both and insinuate storylines about falling in and out of love. I will analyze this further later in this notebook. This finding shows that there may be more similarity in lyrics between the decades than I thought; while the tunes of the songs may have evolved, maybe the lyrical uniqueness has not changed as much."

    "When looking at the `all_female` chart, it is clear that the words \"little\", \"love\", \"heart\", and \"kiss\" stand out. Looking at these words without contextualization, there seems to be a common theme of 'love' and love-related topics in country songs written by female artists from both the 1990s and 2010s. Compared to the female chart, the `all_male` chart used the world \"love\" significantly more; however, it also had much more lyrical variety with references to \"whiskey\", \"world\", and \"mama\". In other words, it is harder to pick up a common theme for songs written by male artists from both decades. Looking at these frequencies, one can see that male and female artists *do* in fact differ (not always in a big way) in the topics and subjects they decide to sing about, thus supporting my hypothesis that there would be some lyrical distinction across genders.

    "### Observations - 1990s vs 2010s \n",
    "\n",
    "Above, I ran KWIC and collocation analyses for `all_90s` and `all_2010s` to see if the word \"love\" is used differently in either chart. Scanning over the printed results from the KWIC analysis, due to the repetition of specific lines, it seems that \"love\" may be appearing in several of the choruses of '90s songs. \"Love\" is either used in the lyrics as a profession of love with the pretexts of \"I\" (as in \"I love you\") or the term is used more generally, when the artists are speaking about a love story. Keeping this in mind, I predict that both the direct and indirect uses of \"love\" will yield similar results in the other corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, given that the word \"love\" appeared significantly less in the `all_2010s` data (19 times compared to 108 in `all_90s`), I figured the context would be different as well. With the 1990s data, \"love\" seemed to have primarily positive connotations; howeber, in the 2010s data, \"love\" seemed to occur in lines with more negative sentiments. The `all_2010s` data places \"love\" around words and phrases that reference love fading and love not being all it is expected to be. Even if you pay close attention to the collocations of the 2010s, \"love\" is surrounded by words such as \"fade\", \"rescue\", and \"careless\". \n",
    "\n",
    "All of this taken into account, there are some differences in the way the term \"love\" is used across decades. "

I want to highlight these contextual words because they  can be linked to a general message of 'being in love' or 'falling in love'. When looking at the `all_male` data, there are some differences, one main difference being that \"I\" prefaces \"love\" significantly more in songs written by male artists. Again, you can see from the concordance lines that there is a lot of repetition that stems from the word \"love\" appearing in core parts of the songs such as the choruses.\n",

    "While working on this final project, one of the primary questions and worries I had with this endeavor was, even if particular words were used across decades and genders, how would I really be able to distinguish the true contexts of each word being used? More specifically, how could I distinguish musical sound-based differences from textual, lyrical differences? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before delving into my findings, I think it is important to acknowledge inherent drawbacks of my project before I highlight the strengths! Given the specificity of my research questions -  personally choosing which decades to analyze and which songs to filter through may have skewed my analysis. I believe that including hit songs from country's earliest days may have been a really interesting additional component to my research project. That being said, I still think I discovered some valuable insight on how the country music genre has evolved over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going through this notebook, I highlighted some lyrical similarities and differences found in lyrics between the decades and by male and female artists. I found that words and phrases used in the 1990s were also used more recently in country music of the 2010s. While shifts in country music sound and style may have surprised country genre supporters and artists, it seems to be that the messages and preaches of songs over time haven't changed all that much. \n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at similarities and differences between male and female artists, my hypothesis standards correct - that there *are in fact*  more significant distinctions between lyrics written by male and female artists than there are between lyrics of different times. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I were to build on my current analysis for this project, I would have taken a closer look at the actual songwriters - not just the artist(s) of every song - because that might reveal even more particular results than what I explored throughout this notebook and my data analysis notebooks. In other words, my analysis might have been more targeted and precise if I analyzed songs written by the best songwriters of specific decades and then split them up into gender dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for coming along with me on my journey to understanding the evolution of country music over time! I hope you enjoyed it!"
