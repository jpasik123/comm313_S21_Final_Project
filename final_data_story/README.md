## Data Story Presentation for COMM 313 Final Project

## What can we learn about the evolution of country music from analyzing lyrics from the 1990s and 2010s by male and female artists? 

In this folder, you can access my detailed analysis of my most significant findings. 

Throughout my blog post, I will walk you through the various steps I took in an effort to answer my research questions and (dis)prove my hypotheses.

To remind you of each component, see below:

### Research Question

How has the country music genre changed over time – from the 1990s to 2010s? Are there any prevalent changes between men and women both within and between these decades? What evidence can I find through lyrical analysis that could tell me more about where the country genre is headed in the future? What can be expected?

### Hypothesis 

I hypothesize that while there may be diversity in topics over the decades, the lyrical analysis will reveal great similarity in lyrics from the 1990s and 2010s; I believe any substantial lyrical differences will be more prominent between male and female artists. 

Keeping this in mind, I now encourage you to look at my data story and see what I found!
